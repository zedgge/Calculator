Calculator

This was my first real Python project, created in 2019.
It’s a simple command-line calculator built before I had any formal experience with programming.

Description

The program allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Each operation runs interactively in the terminal, allowing the user to keep entering numbers until they choose to stop. The calculator clears the screen between operations for readability.

Notes

Written entirely from scratch using only the Python standard library.

Developed by reading documentation and online forums — no external help or AI tools existed at the time.

Some functions contain small logical or naming mistakes (kept intentionally to preserve the original version).

Requires Python 3.

Purpose

This project marks the starting point of my programming journey. It was my first attempt at combining logic, input handling, and function structure in Python.
